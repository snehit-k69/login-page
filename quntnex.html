    <h2> java fullstack</h2>
    <p> Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.<br>
         It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<br>
          Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
